  * this is a rename copy of original work done in: https://github.com/DannyCork/python-whois
  * the project is also related to the project: https://github.com/gen1us2k/python-whois
  * both seem derived from a older google.code site: https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-whois
  * aside from the original authors, many others already contributed to these repositories
  * if authors/contributors prefer to be named explicitly, they can add a line in [Historical.txt](Historical.txt)
